# FLUIDOS FlexSim

**Tagline:** Advanced Scheduling and Configuration Simulator for Resource Federation

## Overview

FLUIDOS FlexSim provides an emulation and simulation environment for validating FLUIDOS scheduling, orchestration, and resource federation strategies. It supports the creation of large-scale, on-demand test scenarios for experimental activities, including those difficult to reproduce in physical deployments. It is especially useful for testing security and privacy components, such as dynamic scheduling with trust and policy constraints.
